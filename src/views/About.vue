    <h1>About the Game</h1>
    <p>Hi, after using Three.js for a few weeks at work, I thought it was about time to do a side project.</p>
    <p>This game is very inspired by <a href="//minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>, and the <a href="https://threejs.org/examples/?q=voxel#webgl_interactive_voxelpainter">Three.js Voxelpainter example</a>.</p>
    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pan the camera by holding left click and moving the mouse</li>
      <li>zoom out and in using your scroll wheel</li>
      <li>place blocks by right clicking, and left to remove</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
